This parser is designed to compile with an OCaml installation that has
labltk.  If your platform does not provide native compilation, use
"make byte" instead of "make".

If you have labltk installed, and your platform supports the OCaml
native code compilation, for an example, type:
   make
   ./mgtdbp

   h

We have a few example grammars in this directory:
   mg0.ml mg1.ml mg2.ml mg_ne.ml mg_nt.ml mg_nz.ml mg_xx.ml
To use one of them, for example mg_xx.ml, execute:
    newg mg_xx
  this should copy mg_xx.ml to g0.ml and compile it
- then start as described above

To use your own grammar, yourg:
- create yourg.ml
  (compare mg0.ml, provided here)
- then execute:
    newg yourg
  this should copy your grammar to g0.ml and compile it
- then start as described above

The minimum probability bound on derivations is specified in the
last line of top.ml

After compiling, to keep the executable and docs but remove intermediate files:
   make clean

To clean up everything and re-compile:
   make realclean
   make
