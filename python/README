This directory contains files for a Python 2.x/NLTK implementation of
the original MG and the MGA parser that is in development parser.

Using NLTK installed under Python 2.7, you can start the MG parser 
with the files in this directory by typing, in a terminal window:
         python mgtdbp-dev.py
Actually, For line mode editing, you can start the parser with: 
         rlwrap python mgtdbp-dev.py
But that will explain that parsing begins only when given a grammar, a
start category, and a minimum probability, you should really use a
command like this:
         rlwrap python mgtdbp.py mg0 C 0.0001
(This starts the loop given by the command at the bottom of mgtdbp.py.)
Python will then prompt you for a sentence to parse with the grammar
specified in your command line.
So if the grammar is mg0, as above, you could type one of:
         the king prefers the beer
         which queen says the king knows which wine the queen prefers
Then you will be given a prompt to which you can type
         h
to get a list of the options.

Right now, the MGA parser is still in development and is located in ./dev/mgatdb-dev.py

To play with the MGA parser, you must execute that file from within a python terminal: execfile('mgatdb-dev.py')
and then you can play around with some of the inner functions.  Note: it doesn't completely work yet ... but we're getting there!
