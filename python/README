We use the NLTK http://www.nltk.org/ environment mainly so we can use
the display tools.  See the NLTK installation instructions
http://nltk.org/install.html.

Since NLTK wants Python 2.5-2.7 together with the Python Tkinter GUI,
the implementation was done using 2.7.  (We are now porting this code
to other versions of Python.

Using NLTK installed under Python 2.7, you can start the parser by
typing, in a terminal window:
         python mgtdbp-dev.py
Actually, For line mode editing, you can start the parser with: 
         rlwrap python mgtdbp-dev.py
But that command will cause the program to explain that parsing begins
only when given a grammar, a start category, and a minimum
probability, so you should really use a command like this:
         rlwrap python mgtdbp.py mg0 C 0.0001
This starts the loop given by the command at the bottom of mgtdbp.py,
using grammar mg0.py, with start category C, and throwing out all parses
with probability lower than 0.0001.
Python will then prompt you for a sentence to parse with the grammar
specified in your command line.
So if the grammar is mg0, as above, you could type one of:
         the king prefers the beer
         which queen says the king knows which wine the queen prefers
Then you will be given a prompt to which you can type
         h
to get a list of the options.
