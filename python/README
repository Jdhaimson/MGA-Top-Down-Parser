This directory contains files for a Python 2.x/NLTK implementation
of the parser.

The python3 subdirectory has the similar files for Python 3.x together
with a port of the NLTK drawing tools to Python 3.x.

NLTK http://www.nltk.org/ works with Python 2.7, and we began with
that environment mainly to make use of their tree display tools.
See the NLTK installation instructions if you want to have the full 
NLTK environment: http://nltk.org/install.html.

Using NLTK installed under Python 2.7, you can start the parser 
with the files in this directory by typing, in a terminal window:
         python mgtdbp-dev.py
Actually, For line mode editing, you can start the parser with: 
         rlwrap python mgtdbp-dev.py
But that will explain that parsing begins only when given a grammar, a
start category, and a minimum probability, you should really use a
command like this:
         rlwrap python mgtdbp.py mg0 C 0.0001
(This starts the loop given by the command at the bottom of mgtdbp.py.)
Python will then prompt you for a sentence to parse with the grammar
specified in your command line.
So if the grammar is mg0, as above, you could type one of:
         the king prefers the beer
         which queen says the king knows which wine the queen prefers
Then you will be given a prompt to which you can type
         h
to get a list of the options.
