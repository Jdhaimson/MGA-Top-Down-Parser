This directory contains a Python 3.x implementation of the parser,
together with a port of the NLTK tree drawing tools.

Using Python 3.x, you can start the parser by typing, in a terminal window:
         python3.3 mgtdbp-dev.py
Actually, For line mode editing, you can start the parser with: 
         rlwrap python3.3 mgtdbp-dev.py
But that will explain that parsing begins only when given a grammar, a
start category, and a minimum probability, you should really use a
command like this:
         rlwrap python3.3 mgtdbp.py mg0 C 0.0001
(This starts the loop given by the command at the bottom of mgtdbp.py.)
Python will then prompt you for a sentence to parse with the grammar
specified in your command line.
So if the grammar is mg0, as above, you could type one of:
         the king prefers the beer
         which queen says the king knows which wine the queen prefers
Then you will be given a prompt to which you can type
         h
to get a list of the options.
