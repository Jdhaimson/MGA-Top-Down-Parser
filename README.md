MGA top-down beam parsing
========================

This is my final project for [6.s974: Language, Computation and Biology](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/academic-information/subject-updates-ft-2014/6s974) in Fall 2014.  It is a python implementation of a minimalist grammar with adjunction (MGA) parser as described in:

- Fowlie (2014) Order and Optionality: Minimalist Grammars with Adjunction
http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/mol/mol13/14.pdf

This parser was adapted from the top-down beam parser for MG[+SpIC_mrg] which is described in 

- Stabler (2012) Two models of minimimalist, incremental, syntactic analysis.
http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/stabler/Stabler12-2models.pdf

See the wiki:  https://github.com/epstabler/mgtdb/wiki
and README in the subdirectories for details.
