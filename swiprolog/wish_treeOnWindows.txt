1.) Run or re-download setup.exe from www.cygwin.com
*Default options should work fine but I'll specify them to be sure

2.) Choose Installation Type:
-Mark Install From Internet option

3.) Choose Installation Directory:
-Choose the same Root directory you did to install Cygwin, default is C:\cygwin
-Mark All User option

4.) Select Local Package Directory:
-Suggest choosing the same directory setup.exe is in but you can put it somewhere else if you wish

5.) Select Connection Type:
-Mark Direct Connection option

6.) Choose A Download Site:
-Pick a download site from the list, shouldn't matter much which one

7.)Select Packages:
-You want to install the following packages
xorg-server
xinit
xorg-docs
*If you don't see the package while searching, click the category X11 to open the folder
-Let it download and install the packages

8.) Launch the Cygwin terminal
-Enter the command 'startxwin'
*This may take a while to process
-You now should see a new window pop-up, it acts just like the Cygwin terminal but should work with wish_tree as seen in lecture
-Can test quickly by entering the command 'wish' which should pop-up a new blank window

-If you get the error message "startxwin: Another X server instance is running on DISPLAY :0 
: Resource temporarily unavailable" it means X11 is already running.
You can launch a new X11 window by right-clicking on the X icon on the task bar on the bottom right selecting Applications and then xterm
